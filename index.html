                <p id="p1">Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune
                    district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth. The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as
                    a holiday commemorating Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).[a][17][18] Shivaji was named after a
                    local deity, the goddess Shivai Devi.[19][20] Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general
                    who served the Deccan Sultanates.[21] His mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of
                    Sindhkhed, a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.The
                    Bijapur sultanate was displeased at their losses to Shivaji's forces, which their vassal Shahaji
                    disavowed. After a peace treaty with the Mughals, and the general acceptance of the young Ali Adil
                    Shah II as the sultan, the Bijapur government became more stable, and turned its attention towards
                    Shivaji.[38] In 1657 the sultan, or more likely his mother and regent, sent Afzal Khan, a veteran
                    general, to arrest Shivaji. Before engaging him, the Bijapuri forces desecrated the Tulja Bhavani
                    Temple, holy to Shivaji's family, and the Vithoba temple at Pandharpur, a major pilgrimage site for
                    the Hindus</p>
